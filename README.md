- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that the code I am writing is functional by creating rigorous test cases to check that it is functioning correctly. Making sure that the code errors when it is supposed to will also help to check the security of the code.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs, I consider the functionality of the program and how this programming is going to assist its users in tasks. By examining the functions of the program and contemplating the needs of the users, while also incorporating all of the necessary functionality, we can build better software for the users who will be using it.

- How do I approach designing software?

Designing software can be a complex process. The best approach to software design would be to follow the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). This framework for developing software should assist in planning, documenting, and guiding the project to completion. It encompasses all the necessary steps to create functional software. All you have to do is follow it to completion, which is the challenging part.
